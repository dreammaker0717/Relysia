              PayPal as a payment processor On this website, the controller has
              integrated components of PayPal. PayPal is an online payment
              service provider. Payments are processed via so-called PayPal
              accounts, which represent virtual private or business accounts.
              PayPal is also able to process virtual payments through credit
              cards when a user does not have a PayPal account. A PayPal account
              is managed via an e-mail address, which is why there are no
              classic account numbers. PayPal makes it possible to trigger
              online payments to third parties or to receive payments. PayPal
              also accepts trustee functions and offers buyer protection
              services. The European operating company of PayPal is PayPal
              (Europe) S.à.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, 2449
              Luxembourg, Luxembourg. If the data subject chooses "PayPal" as
              the payment option during the online ordering process, we
              automatically transmit the data of the data subject to PayPal. By
              selecting this payment option, the data subject agrees to the
              transfer of personal data required for payment processing. The
              personal data transmitted to PayPal is usually first name, last
              name, address, email address, IP address, telephone number, mobile
              phone number, or other data necessary for payment processing. The
              processing of the purchase contract also requires such personal
              data, which are in connection with the respective order. The
              transmission of the data is aimed at payment processing and fraud
              prevention. The controller will transfer personal data to PayPal,
              in particular, if a legitimate interest in the transmission is
              given. The personal data exchanged between PayPal and the
              controller for the processing of the data will be transmitted by
              PayPal to economic credit agencies. This transmission is intended
              for identity and creditworthiness checks. PayPal will, if
              necessary, pass on personal data to affiliates and service
              providers or subcontractors to the extent that this is necessary
              to fulfill contractual obligations or for data to be processed in
              the order. The data subject has the possibility to revoke consent
              for the handling of personal data at any time from PayPal. A
              revocation shall not have any effect on personal data which must
              be processed, used or transmitted in accordance with (contractual)
              payment processing. The applicable data protection provisions of
              PayPal may be retrieved under

              goods or services. Suggest that you may receive a different price
              or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of
              goods or services. However, we may offer you certain financial
              incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different
              prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial
              incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal
              Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the
              program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive
              program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke
              at any time. California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code
              Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Mobile Application that
              are California residents to request certain information regarding
              our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their
              direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send us
              an electronic message through our Mobile Application or write us
              at our email address listed on our webpage. 13. DO WE MAKE UPDATES
              TO THIS POLICY? We may update this privacy policy from time to
              time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
              “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon
              as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy
              policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice
              of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We
              encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be
              informed of how we are protecting your information. 14. HOW CAN
